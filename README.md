# Dynamo Scripts library for Autodesk Revit

## Description

Scripts for Dynamo using IronPython.
Version v1.3.4 is mostly used during the development

## Main feautures
* Works with mostly all versions of Dynamo for Revit *(1.3.4 and higher)*
* Main code is stored in a separate `*.py` file in order to get the updates from the repository

## Installation and Usage
1. Download the installation file from Github repository: [`01_Install_RPW_v1.3.4.dyn`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romangolev/dynamo-scripts/master/nodes/01_Install_RPW_v1.3.4.dyn)
1. Run installation file. By default the installation file downloads dependencies into `C:\Temp\dynamo-python`
1. You can download any the `*.dyn` file from the folder called [`/nodes`](https://github.com/romangolev/dynamo-scripts/tree/master/nodes) or easily [download full repository](https://github.com/romangolev/dynamo-scripts/archive/master.zip)
1. You can use `*.dyn` file as a usual dynamo file by opening it in Dynamo editor or by choosing a desired directory with Dynamo player

* Dynamo 1.3.4 or higher
